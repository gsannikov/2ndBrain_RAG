# Project Discovery & Intent Documentation

## What Is This Project?

**2ndBrain_RAG** is an attempt to solve the problem: *"How can I ask questions about my personal documents using AI?"*

### The Problem It Solves

Most people accumulate knowledge across many files: PDFs, notes, research papers, emails, etc. This knowledge is hard to search through and even harder to ask questions about.

**Traditional approach**:
- Open finder, search by filename
- Skim through PDF manually
- Hope the info is still relevant

**2ndBrain_RAG approach**:
- "What were the key findings from my research?"
- AI searches semantically (meaning-based, not keyword-based)
- Returns cited answers with source files
- All runs locally (privacy-first)

### The Innovation: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

Instead of:
```
Your Question → LLM (may hallucinate) → Answer
```

It does:
```
Your Question → Find relevant documents → LLM reads context → Answer with citations
```

**Benefit**: Answers are grounded in your actual documents, not made up.

## Why Build This?

### Market Gap
- **Cloud RAG** (Pinecone, OpenAI): Expensive, privacy concerns, require API keys
- **No local solution** existed for personal knowledge bases
- **Ollama** made local LLMs accessible (new opportunity)

### Design Philosophy
1. **Local-First**: All data on your machine, no cloud dependency
2. **Privacy**: No tracking, no data collection
3. **Open Source**: Transparent, modifiable
4. **Simple**: No complex configuration, just put files in a folder
5. **Free**: No API costs, no subscriptions

---

## How It Works (User Perspective)

### Setup (5 minutes)
```bash
1. Install Ollama: https://ollama.com
2. Download 2ndBrain_RAG
3. bash scripts/install.sh
4. Done!
```

### Usage
```bash
# Put your PDFs, notes, etc. in ~/2ndBrain_RAG/

# Ask a question (via Claude Desktop)
"What are the main principles in my research?"

# Get back
"Based on your documents:
 - Principle 1: ...  [1]
 - Principle 2: ...  [2]
 [Citations list]"
```

### Behind the Scenes
```
1. Files automatically indexed when changed
2. Semantic search finds relevant pages
3. LLM reads context + your question
4. Generates answer with citations
```

## Technical Decisions & Rationale

### Why FastAPI?
- **Modern**: Async-ready, type hints
- **Simple**: Minimal boilerplate
- **Well-integrated**: Works with Ollama HTTP API
- **Easy debugging**: Auto-generated API docs (/docs)

### Why ChromaDB?
- **Local**: No server needed
- **Persistent**: Data survives restart
- **Vector-native**: Optimized for similarity search
- **Python API**: Simple to use

### Why sentence-transformers?
- **Free**: No API key needed
- **Fast**: Runs on CPU
- **Good quality**: Trained on semantic similarity
- **Deterministic**: Same text → same embedding always

### Why Ollama?
- **Local inference**: Privacy + offline capability
- **Simple**: One command to start (`ollama serve`)
- **Model variety**: Swap models by model name
- **HTTP API**: Easy to integrate

### Why Watchdog?
- **Event-driven**: Efficient file monitoring
- **Cross-platform**: macOS, Linux, Windows
- **Active maintenance**: Well-maintained library
- **No polling**: Doesn't hammer CPU

## Current State (Oct 2025)

### Status: Working Prototype
- ✅ Core RAG pipeline implemented
- ✅ Document indexing works
- ✅ Semantic search works
- ✅ Chat with Ollama works
- ✅ MCP integration ready
- ⚠️ No authentication (personal use only)
- ⚠️ No production hardening
- ⚠️ No comprehensive testing

### What Works
1. **Document Loading**: Supports 13+ file formats
2. **Auto-Sync**: File watcher reindexes on changes
3. **Semantic Search**: Vector-based matching
4. **RAG Chat**: Answer questions with context
5. **MCP Protocol**: Works with Claude Desktop

### What Doesn't Work
1. **Scaling**: Reindexes everything on file change (inefficient)
2. **Performance**: Slow on large document sets (>1GB)
3. **Security**: No authentication or input validation
4. **Reliability**: Limited error recovery

## Design Patterns Used

### Pattern 1: Pipeline Pattern
```
Input → Loader → Chunker → Embedder → Storage → Retriever → LLM → Output
```
Each stage independent, can be replaced.

### Pattern 2: Observer Pattern
```
FileSystem events → Watcher → ReindexHandler → Database update
```
Decouples file monitoring from indexing logic.

### Pattern 3: Adapter Pattern
```
Ollama HTTP API ← LLM Adapter ← FastAPI endpoint
```
Abstracts different LLM backends.

### Pattern 4: Repository Pattern
```
ChromaDB (implementation) ← Vector Store Interface (abstraction)
```
Can swap ChromaDB for other vector stores.

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. **FastAPI + Uvicorn**: Perfect for this use case
2. **Sentence-transformers**: Good balance of speed/quality
3. **ChromaDB**: Simple and effective
4. **Watchdog**: Reliable file monitoring
5. **Ollama**: Game-changer for local LLMs

### What Could Be Better
1. **Threading model**: Single-threaded FastAPI + background thread prone to races
2. **Error handling**: Too generic, hard to debug
3. **Logging**: Using print() instead of proper logger
4. **Testing**: No tests makes refactoring risky
5. **Configuration**: Too hardcoded, not flexible enough

### Key Insights
- **Local > Cloud** for personal projects (privacy, latency)
- **Embedding model choice** matters more than vector store
- **File watching** is harder than it seems (debouncing, multiple events)
- **Chunking strategy** is crucial for RAG quality
- **Simple is better** when starting out
