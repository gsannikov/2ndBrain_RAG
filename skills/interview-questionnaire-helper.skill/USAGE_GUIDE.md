## How to Use the Skill

### Mode 1: Fill Initial Data (Building Your Answer Bank)

**When to use**: You have questions but haven't written personal answers yet.

**How to trigger**:
- "Help me fill in my interview answers"
- "Let's work on my Tell Me About Yourself questions"
- "I need to complete my interview questionnaire"

**What happens**:
1. The skill fetches your Notion page
2. Finds questions without answers
3. Works through them one by one:
   - Shows you the question and guide
   - Asks probing questions to draw out details
   - Helps you structure your answer (STAR method, etc.)
   - Gives feedback and suggestions
   - Saves your refined answer to Notion
4. Moves to the next question

**Example conversation**:
```
You: "Help me fill in my interview answers"

Claude: "I'll help you build comprehensive answers for your interview 
questions. Let me fetch your Notion page...

I found 8 questions that need answers. Let's start with the first one:

**Question**: Tell me about yourself

**Guide**: The interviewer wants to understand your professional story. 
Use a chronological narrative covering your current role, key experiences, 
and why you're interested in this role. Keep it to 1-2 minutes.

To help craft your answer, tell me:
1. What's your current role and what do you do?
2. What led you to this career path?
3. What are 2-3 key experiences that shaped your professional journey?"

You: [Provide your thoughts]

Claude: [Asks follow-up questions, helps structure, refines answer, 
then saves to Notion]
```

### Mode 2: Review Questions Before Interview (Practice & Tailor)

**When to use**: You have an interview coming up and want to practice with job-specific focus.

**How to trigger**:
- "I have an interview at [Company] tomorrow, help me practice"
- "Can we review my answers for this specific job?" [include job link]
- "I want to practice interview questions for [role]"

**What happens**:
1. You provide the job posting or describe the role
2. The skill analyzes what the role needs
3. Conducts a mock interview with relevant questions
4. Gives real-time feedback on your answers
5. Suggests how to tailor responses to the job
6. Offers to create a job-specific copy of your answers in Notion

**Example conversation**:
```
You: "I have an interview at Google for a Product Manager role tomorrow. 
Here's the job posting: [link]"

Claude: "Great! I've analyzed the role - Google is looking for someone 
with strong technical collaboration skills, data-driven decision making, 
and experience launching products at scale.

Let me review your existing answers and then we'll do a practice session. 
[Reviews Notion page]

Ready to practice? I'll ask you questions most relevant to this PM role. 
Try to keep your answers to 1-2 minutes and I'll give you feedback.

Let's start with: Tell me about a time you used data to make a product 
decision..."

[After practice session]

Claude: "Strong practice session! A few adjustments for Google specifically:
- Emphasize your cross-functional collaboration more
- Add metrics to your product launch story
- Connect your experience with their focus on user research

Would you like me to create a tailored version of your answers 
specifically for this Google PM interview?"
```

### Mode 3: Additional Questions & Frameworks (Expand Your Prep)

**When to use**: You've completed basic questions and want to add more depth.

**How to trigger**:
- "What other interview questions should I prepare for?"
- "Can you suggest more questions for [tech/consulting/finance] interviews?"
- "Help me expand my question bank for [target company]"

**What happens**:
1. Reviews your current questions
2. Identifies gaps in your preparation
3. Searches for commonly asked questions at target companies/industries
4. Proposes 3-5 strategic additions with explanations
5. Helps you craft answers to new questions (following Mode 1)

**Example conversation**:
```
You: "I've filled in all the basic questions. What else should I prepare 
for tech company interviews?"

Claude: "Let me review your current question bank and identify gaps...

Based on your existing preparation and tech interview trends, I recommend 
adding these 5 questions:

1. **"Why do you want to work in tech?"**
   - Why: Almost universal in tech interviews
   - Gap: You don't have a tech-specific motivation question
   - Category: Motivation & Goals

2. **"Tell me about a time you had to influence without authority"**
   - Why: Critical for tech PMs and eng leads
   - Gap: Your teamwork section lacks an influence example
   - Category: Teamwork & Leadership

3. **"How do you prioritize features with limited resources?"**
   - Why: Common for product/engineering roles
   - Gap: Missing a prioritization framework question
   - Category: Problem-Solving & Impact

[...continues with 2 more questions]

Which questions would you like to add to your Notion page?"

You: "Let's add questions 1, 2, and 3"

Claude: "Great choice! Let's start with 'Why do you want to work in tech?' 
[Begins Mode 1 workflow for each question]"
```
