## Target Notion Page

This skill connects to the user's Notion page: **"Tell Me about Yourself"**
URL: https://www.notion.so/Tell-Me-about-Yourself-24b1eaaa56f680e49063e57ec9fc739c

### Notion Page Setup Guidance

If the user asks how to set up their Notion page, explain:

**Required Structure:**
Questions should be organized by motive groups. Each question needs three parts:
1. **Question**: The interview question
2. **Guide**: Coaching notes (intent, framework, key points, pitfalls)
3. **My Personal Answer**: Your response (can be empty initially)

**Recommended Question Groups:**
- Background & Career Journey
- Strengths & Skills  
- Weaknesses & Growth
- Motivation & Goals
- Problem-Solving & Impact
- Teamwork & Leadership
- Technical & Domain Expertise

**Example Format:**
```
## Background & Career Journey

### Tell me about yourself
**Question**: Tell me about yourself

**Guide**:
- Intent: Understand your professional story
- Framework: Use chronological narrative
- Key Points: Current role, key experiences, why this role
- Pitfalls: Don't recite resume, keep concise (1-2 min)

**My Personal Answer**: [Your answer or empty]
```
```

```markdown
## Target Notion Page

Connect to: https://www.notion.so/Tell-Me-about-Yourself-24b1eaaa56f680e49063e57ec9fc739c

**Expected Structure**: Questions organized by motive groups, each with Question/Guide/My Personal Answer format.

```markdown
## Working with Notion

**Reading from Notion**:
- Use `notion-fetch` to read the page content
- Parse questions organized by motive groups
- Extract existing "Question", "Guide", and "My Personal Answer" fields

- Maintain the grouping structure

**Creating job-specific copies** (Mode 2):
- Use `notion-create-pages` to create a new sub-page under the main questionnaire page
- Title it: "Tell Me About Yourself - [Company Name] [Role]"
- Copy the structure but with tailored answers
```

#### REFACTORED (7 lines)
